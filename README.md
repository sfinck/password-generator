# password-generator

Overwiew: 
This project was intended to create a generalized password. The user had a scope of criteria that they could choose in order to build their password. The main criteria was making sure that the password was no less than 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. The only other main criteria is that they had to chose atleast one type of character or the password could not be generated. 

The webpage begins with a prompt that asks "How many characters would you like your password to be?" 

It continues to confirm the desired usage of uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and special characters.

Once all of those confirms are declared true or false the generator comes up with a password that matches the users' needs. 

Installation: 
To build this I had to use a couple of different methods. 

I started with an array of possible characters the user could choose from.

I then created conditions for according to their answers (confirm or cancel).

Next, I created a for loop that took all of the inputted information and randomized it, all while using the desired number of characters. 

Challenges: 
My main challenge was time. The homework activity looked fairly simple, but it turned out to be more complicated than I thought. My other obstacle was trying to figure out, after making all the necessary arrays and collecting the answers, how to combine the arrays together to display the password. My plan is to try some other techniques to see what option works most effectively with the page.
