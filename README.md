# password-generator

Overwiew: 
This project was intended to create a generalized password. The user had a scope of criteria that they could choose in order to build their password. The main criteria was making sure that the password was no less than 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. The only otehr main criteria is that they had to chose atleast one type of character or the password could not be generated. 

The webpage begins with a prompt that asks "How many characters would you like your password to be?" 

It continues to confirm the usage of uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and special characters.

Once all of those confirms are declared true or false the generator comes up with a password that matches the users' needs.
